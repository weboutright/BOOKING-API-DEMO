# üö® TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Check Your Apps Script Setup

**In Google Apps Script (script.google.com):**

‚úÖ **Calendar ID Updated:**
- Open your Apps Script project
- Look at the top of the code for: `const CALENDAR_ID = 'd3988770ac4...'`
- Make sure it matches your calendar ID exactly

‚úÖ **Calendar API Enabled:**
- In Apps Script, click "Services" (+ icon) on the left
- You should see "Google Calendar API" listed
- If not, add it by searching "Google Calendar API" and clicking "Add"

‚úÖ **Authorization Completed:**
- In Apps Script, click any function dropdown and select "checkAdminAuth"
- Click "Run" - you should be prompted to authorize
- Click "Review permissions" ‚Üí "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to [Your Project]" ‚Üí "Allow"

‚úÖ **Deployed as Web App:**
- Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "New deployment" (not "Manage deployments")
- Type: "Web app"
- Execute as: "Me"
- Who has access: "Anyone"
- Click "Deploy" and copy the new URL

### 2. Check Your Frontend Setup

‚úÖ **Config.js URL:**
- Open `config.js`
- Make sure the URL matches your Apps Script deployment URL exactly
- Should end with `/exec`

‚úÖ **File Structure:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple-booking.html  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple-admin.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple-appscript.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ debug-connection.html (for testing)
```

### 3. Test Connection

‚úÖ **Open debug-connection.html:**
- Should show your API URL
- Should show connection test results
- Green ‚úÖ = working, Red ‚ùå = problem

### 4. Common Error Solutions

**"Calendar not accessible" or "Calendar Access Denied":**
- Your calendar ID is wrong OR
- Calendar API not enabled OR  
- Not authorized in Apps Script

**"Connection Failed" or CORS errors:**

### 5. Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Delete your current Apps Script deployment**
2. **Copy the LATEST simple-appscript.js code** (with your calendar ID)
3. **Enable Calendar API service**  
4. **Run a function to authorize**
5. **Create a NEW deployment** (don't reuse old ones)
6. **Update config.js** with the new URL
7. **Test with debug-connection.html**

### 6. Get More Help

**Check Apps Script Logs:**
- In Apps Script ‚Üí "Executions" tab

The #1 problem is usually the calendar ID. Make sure:
- It's the EXACT ID from Google Calendar settings
- It's in the CALENDAR_ID constant at the top of simple-appscript.js
- You created a NEW deployment after updating the code
